# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of student performance based on a provided dataset. The dataset includes information about students, including their name, age, score, gender, term, and academic year. The objective is to gain insights into factors influencing academic performance and provide visualizations for a comprehensive understanding.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset file (e.g., `student_data.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **`images/`**: Directory to store images and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation with an overview, instructions, and findings.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd student-performance-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore, analyze, and visualize the data.

2. Execute the cells in order to generate visualizations and insights.

3. View the generated visualizations in the `images/` directory.

## Project Findings

- Descriptive statistics, gender analysis, academic year analysis, correlation insights, score distribution, and term-wise performance visualizations.
- Key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- dash (if using Dash for a dashboard)
