# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of student performance based on a provided dataset. The dataset includes information about students, including their name, age, score, gender, term, and academic year. The objective is to gain insights into factors influencing academic performance and provide visualizations for a comprehensive understanding.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset file (e.g., `student_data.xlsx`).
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation with an overview, instructions, and findings.
